Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a neural network model that can predict whether applicants 
will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup, a philanthropic foundation. The model is trained on historical 
data from previous applicants, which includes various features about each applicant and a binary label 
indicating whether they were ultimately successful.

Results
Data Preprocessing
Target Variable: The target for the model is IS_SUCCESSFUL which indicates whether the money funded to the applicant 
was used effectively.
Feature Variables: Features include various properties of the applicants such as organization type, use of the application, 
funding amount, and others that were deemed relevant after initial analysis.
Variables Removed: Variables that were removed include non-informative identifiers such as EIN and NAME, as they do not 
contribute to the model's predictive performance.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
Model Architecture: The model includes several layers with relu activations for intermediate layers and a sigmoid activation for the output layer. Specific details from the notebooks indicate:
First hidden layer: 80 neurons, relu activation
Second hidden layer: 30 neurons, relu activation
Output layer: 1 neuron, sigmoid activation
Model Performance: The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 76% on the validation dataset.
Performance Improvement Attempts: Several techniques were tested to improve model performance, including:
Adjusting the number of neurons in each layer.
Increasing the number of epochs.
Modifying layer activation functions.
Experimenting with different optimization algorithms.
